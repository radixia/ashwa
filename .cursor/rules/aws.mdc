# Overview

- we are using AWS
- all the infrastructure is on AWS, except the functions which are provided by Vercel
- use AWS CDK to create resources
- the CDK app is under infrastructure/
- resources with static names should be marked with a deletion policy = retain on update

# Key rules

## Naming

- When naming resources, prefer static naming
- Append prod/stage/dev based on resource specification

## Services

- Prefer serverless services such as DynamoDB
- Never provision capacity

## Database

- Use DynamoDB Single-table Design
- Ensure TTLs are used so we don't store data indefinetly
- Make sure deletionProtection is turned on
- Make sure PITR is turned on

## Storage

- In S3, create lifecycle policies for all objects
- Ensure buckets are encrypted
- Make sure versioning is enforced

## Permissions

- Strictly adhere to the minimum permissions principle

## Backups

- Configure a backup vault
- Configure appropriate backup plans for buckets and databases
