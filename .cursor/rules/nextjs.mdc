# Guidelines for Next.js projects

## React rules

- do not create APIs, use server components and server actions instead
- do not fetch data in client components: fetch in server components and pass to client components if needed
- avoid hooks unless strictly necessary
- add loading skeletons for pages (add loading.tsx) matching the page structure
- add 'use client' directive when required (e.g, components has event handlers or hooks) 
- add 'use server' directive for server actions only
- avoid using inline server actions, prefer having an actions.ts file colocated with the server component
- use 'import "server-only";' for code using server-only secret keys (e.g, database, OpenAI)

## i18n

- translations are managed using the next-intl package
- do not include raw strings in ts/tsx files but use the translation
- always add translations to client/messages/en.json and client/messages/it.json
- we support by default en and it, unless specified otherwise in project rules

## UI

- dark mode is not needed
- use shadcn components
- use this command to install @shadcn components: pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>
- when adding buttons, mr-2/ml-2 is not needed to separate text and icon since it has been recently added to shadcn template
- when importing icons, import the *Icon variant (to avoid confusion with other component imports)

## Next 15 specific rules

- we're using Next.js 15 with App Router
- use next/navigation, do not import next/router
- pages are in the app/ folder
- searchParams prop in pages are now a Promise, you need to await searchParams and add a loading.tsx or wrap the page in a suspense boundary
- use server components, then fallback to client components if interactivity is needed
- use server actions for form submissions
- in package.json, dev command is "next dev --experimental-https"

## Forbidden to...

- never use themes
- do not use themes
- avoid adding providers
