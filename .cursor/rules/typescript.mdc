# Guidelines for Typescript projects

## Typescript Rules

- always use typed code
- do not use "any"
- do not use "import type" as it's not necessary
- create and update types when necessary
- import existing types and type packages if existing (avoid creating types if the library exports them)
- create and update zod validations when appropriate
