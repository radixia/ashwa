## Rules for this project

- do not include raw strings in ts/tsx files; use the translation libraries; add translations to messages/en.json and messages/it.json
- code should be modular and reusable, avoid duplicating too much code
- do not create duplicate files, make sure to check for existing files before creating new ones with the same scope
- we're using preferably openai apis via the npm 'ai' package and @vercel/sdk. OpenAI model is gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini; do not use other models
- we're using pnpm as package manager
